## Function Visualizer - Independent Study in Qt and OpenGL

Author: Benjamin Slack

Oversight: Dr. Elise DeDoncker, Western Michigan University 

### Abstract:
This project is an exploration of the Qt Application framework and its cooupling 
with modern OpenGL. The goal is to visualize arbitrary functions of multiple
variables holding all but two fixed and allowing the others to vary in the 
xy plane, generating a single output z. This output is then displayed as points
or as a triangle mesh surface.
